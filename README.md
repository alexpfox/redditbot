# redditbot
A reddit bot for /r/empoknor

This bot currently receives text posts via private message from any user.
It then reposts the private message content to r/empoknor, a private subreddit I use with my friends.

The eventual goal is to get this bot posting every time a new video link is recieved via PM, checking every 2 minutes.
I want the bot to interpret the content of the message intelligently (given some formatting.)

First line should be text of the new post's title.
Second line should be the link to a video, hosted anywhere.
